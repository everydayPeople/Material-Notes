Material-Notes
==============

Android Note Application (Lollipop Material Design)

I decided to make this open source, no licence. People can use this as a base for thier own application design, or just to figure out Googles latest visual API's. 

Designed around Googles Material Design guidlines, this is a simple note taking application that save notes locally to the SD card as *.txt files. 

Users Googles new RecycerView and CardView APIs, plus the new scene / activity transitions.

A demo of this app can be found on the Play Store.
